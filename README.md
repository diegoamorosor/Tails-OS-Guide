**Enhance your privacy and anonymity online with Tails OS and the Tor network.**

## üìñ What is Tails?  
**Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System)** is a portable operating system designed to preserve your privacy and anonymity. It can run on almost any computer from a USB stick or DVD and ensures that no traces are left behind after use.  

### Key Features  
- **Privacy**: Encrypts all connections through Tor, shielding your identity.  
- **Anonymity**: Avoids leaving digital footprints on the host computer.  
- **Data Security**: Comes pre-installed with tools like GnuPG for encryption and KeePassXC for password management.  
- **Persistence**: Allows you to securely save encrypted files and settings on your USB stick, without compromising privacy.  
- **Isolation**: Runs independently from the computer's main operating system, ensuring no interaction with or contamination from the host system.

## üåç What is Tor?  
**Tor (The Onion Router)** is a network that anonymizes your internet activity by routing your connection through multiple servers (nodes) worldwide, making tracking or surveillance extremely difficult.  

When paired with Tails, Tor ensures:  
- Encrypted and private browsing.  
- Protection against traffic analysis.  
- Access to websites on the **Dark Web** (e.g., `.onion` sites).
